## Backend refactoring: module restructure

Consolidated `backend/src/` modules for clarity. Eliminated the `public/` and
`operations/` top-level directories. Distributed their contents to `model/`,
`storage/`, `process/`, `router/`, and top-level files (commit 9cd3a2fa7).

### New layout

### Dependency layering

| Module | Depends on | Issues |
|---|---|---|
| `model/abstract_data` | `model::object` | clean |
| `model/config` | `storage::files`, `tasks::batcher::reload_watcher` | legitimate — config save reloads watcher |
| `model/expression` | `process::dir_album` | legitimate — filter evaluation needs dir-album cache |
| `storage/db` | `model::*` | clean |
| `storage/cache` | `model::*`, `storage::db` | clean |
| `storage/files` | nothing in crate | pure filesystem path logic |
| `storage/ser_de` | `model::*` | clean |
| `process/index` | `process::*`, `storage::files`, `tasks::*` | clean |
| `tasks/actor` | `process::*`, `storage::db`, `tasks::*` | clean |
| `tasks/batcher` | `process::dir_album`, `storage::db`, `model::*`, `tasks::*` | clean |
| `router/auth` | `model::*`, `router::*` | clean |

### Resolved issues

1. **`model/abstract_data` → `process/hash` circular dep** —
   `generate_random_data()` on `AbstractData` was dead code after the
   `random::generate_random_data` endpoint was removed. Deleted the method;
   the only remaining caller of `generate_random_hash()` is `process/dir_album.rs`,
   which is in the same layer. No layering violation remains.

2. **`storage/ser_de` → `router/get/get_prefetch` circular dep** —
   `Prefetch` was moved from the router layer to `model/response.rs`.

### Accidental artifact

- `backend/src/lib.rs.bak` — removed.
