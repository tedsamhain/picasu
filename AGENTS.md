# Agent Guidelines

## Communication Style

- Stick to facts and established best practice. Do not editorialize or try to be persuasive.
- In assessments and commit messages, reflect uncertainty where it exists. Avoid asserting things as definitive when the evidence is incomplete.
- Skip superlatives and filler ("Clean.", "Perfect.", "This is the right call."). State what happened or what is true and move on.

## Development Workflow

- Take a step back and consider best-practice solutions before diving in.
- Clarify ambiguous requirements with the user before starting.
- Always present the proposed solution and its trade-offs for review before implementing.
- After implementation, give the user a chance to review before moving on.
- Run all relevant checks and tests before committing. Do not rely on precommit hooks to catch everything.
Refrain from including verbose examples and documentation in git commit messages or this AGENTS.md.
- Commit messages should include a summary of what was changed and why. Do not include verbose examples or documentation. Only large commits may contain lists of changes.

## Task Management (.plan)

Every task lives as a markdown file in `.plan/tasks/<slug>.md` with YAML frontmatter. The filename (without `.md`) is the unique key — no numeric ID needed.

### Status lifecycle

| status        | meaning                   | when to use                                   |
| ------------- | ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `idea`        | aspirational, not settled | explore later, not ready to start             |
| `backlog`     | accepted, deferred        | consider when stepping back to plan next work |
| `open`        | ready                     | actionable, waiting to be picked up           |
| `in-progress` | active                    | currently being worked on                     |
| `blocked`     | stuck                     | note the blocker in the body                  |
| `done`        | complete                  | finished                                      |

### Agent conventions

- **Discover work:** `cargo xtask plan` lists all tasks; `cargo xtask plan -k` groups by status column. Filter with `-s open`, `-a backend`, `-t bug`, etc.
- **Step back / plan:** `cargo xtask plan -k` to see the full board. Pull items from `backlog` or `idea` when choosing what to work on next.
- **Sort:** flags without values become sort keys — `cargo xtask plan -a -p` sorts by area then priority. `-h` prints all options.
- **Create:** copy `.plan/TEMPLATE.md` to `.plan/tasks/<slug>.md`.
- **Update:** update 'status' to reflect status. append progress notes at the bottom (newest first). Do not rewrite history.
- **Complete:** set `status: done` when finished. Do not delete the file.
- **Block:** set `status: blocked` and note the blocker in the body.
- **Validate:** run `cargo xtask plan --lint` to check; `cargo xtask plan --format` to auto-fix. The precommit hook runs `--format` automatically

## Code documentation

Prefer `///` doc comments in the Rust source to document function purpose and any non-obvious design decisions.
Doc comments live next to the code, get updated with it, serve `cargo doc`, IDEs, and agents equally, and never rot.

Items which do not fit into code documentation such as design decisions and usage instructions belong in separate user-focused documentation.

Only document here what cannot be derived from the code itself.

## Non-obvious invariants

- **Album = directory.** Each media item has exactly one album (`metadata.album: Option<ArrayString<64>>`), corresponding to the directory it lives in. Albums are not stored separately — `DIR_ALBUM_CACHE` maps directory paths to album IDs at runtime, rebuilt from the filesystem on every startup. Moving a file to a different album via the API moves the physical file on disk. See `docs/design.md` § Albums.
- **`DIR_ALBUM_CACHE` is a separate `Mutex`.** The album content filter (`generate_filter.rs`) is called while `TREE.in_memory` is already read-locked. Looking up a dir album's path through the tree would deadlock; `DIR_ALBUM_CACHE` avoids this.
- **bitcode encodes struct fields positionally.** Field order in any `Encode`/`Decode` struct is part of the on-disk schema. Adding or reordering fields without a schema version bump silently corrupts existing records.
- **Schema versioning prefix.** Each `AbstractData` record on disk starts with `[0xFF, version]`. `0xFF` is safe because bitcode encodes the 3-variant enum discriminant in bits [1:0] of the first byte (values 0–2); `0xFF` (bits [1:0] = 11) is structurally invalid for the enum and unambiguous as a version marker. Legacy unversioned records (no prefix) are decoded as v1. Schema migration is append-only — never remove a migration wrapper.
- **HTTP error codes must not collide with framework codes.** Rocket returns 404 for unregistered routes. A domain-level "entity not found" must use `ErrorKind::InvalidInput` (→ 400) rather than `ErrorKind::NotFound` (→ 404) to remain distinguishable from routing failures. Reserve `ErrorKind::NotFound` only for cases where a routing-404 is genuinely indistinguishable from the domain error.

[Comment from AI]: # (
Your skepticism is well-placed. The value of AGENTS.md is often oversold. Let me break it down:

What an agent can always derive itself:

- File paths, function names, struct fields — grep/find/Read handle these instantly
- Module structure — tree src/ or cargo modules
- API surface — cargo doc
- Recent changes — git log

What an agent genuinely cannot derive from code:

- Why a design decision was made
- Invariants that are enforced by convention not types
- Gotchas with dependencies .g., bitcode encodes positionally — field order matters
- The dual-runtime split and why it exists

That second list is short, stable, and doesn't rot — because if the invariant
breaks, the system breaks. That's the only content worth putting in AGENTS.md.

Deterministic options for code indexing:

- cargo doc --document-private-items — full symbol index, always current
- rust-analyzer LSP — agents with LSP support get this for free
- cargo modules generate tree — module dependency graph
- A justfile with documented recipes covering build/test/run workflows

Practical recommendation:

Keep AGENTS.md to under ~50 lines covering only the non-derivable invariants
and gotchas. Invest the saved effort into good /// doc comments in the Rust
source — they serve humans, IDEs, cargo doc, and agents equally, and they live
next to the code they describe so they actually get updated.
